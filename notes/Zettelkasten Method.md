# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten method is a note-taking and knowledge management system developed by Niklas Luhmann.

## Key Principles
1. Atomicity: one idea per note
2. Autonomy: each note should be understandable on its own
3. Linking: create connections between notes
4. Indexing: unique identification system

## Benefits
- Promotes non-linear thinking
- Encourages the creation of new ideas
- Facilitates information retrieval

## Implementation in Obsidian
- Use bidirectional links
- Create an index or table of contents
- Use tags for flexible categorization
