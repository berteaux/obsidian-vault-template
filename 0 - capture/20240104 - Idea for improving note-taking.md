# Idea: Combining Zettelkasten and PARA in Obsidian
- Use Obsidian to create a knowledge management system
- Integrate Zettelkasten principles for note creation
- Use PARA structure for overall organization
- Potential benefits:
  1. Better organization of ideas
  2. Easier information retrieval
  3. Creation of links between concepts

TODO: Research existing templates and create an implementation plan
